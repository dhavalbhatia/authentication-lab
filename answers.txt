Q1. Django uses a user authentication system/Basic Authentication. It handles both authentication and authorization.
    Authentication determines who an authorized user is.
    Authorization is what an authenticated user can do.

Q2. -a and -auth uses HTTP Basic authentication. It uses user credentials to authenticate user

Q3. Session based authentication stores user credentials/authentication details. In token based authentication
    the client stores them. 

    Token auth is better than basic because creating tokens is more convenient and easier than having to
    change user's account details. And if it is compromised, only the API's are exposed and not user's
    master account.

Q4. When you login with google. You are redirected to google's endpoint to verify your account ther.
    Once successfully verified, google sends an authorization token back to bitbucket.
    Bitbucket can then use this authorization token to identify it to your google account
